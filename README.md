# delictive_incidence_cdmx
EDA of the reported delicts in CDMX from 2016 to mid-2019
As a part of a job interviewing process, they required me to make this Jupyter notebook. I liked it a lot since it's based on actual data, so it involves 
lots of cleaning. Also, it is a subject that I think data science can help to alleviate and it requires different skills to solve it.

In this notebook I attempted to answer the following questions:

a. Which is the year with most crimes committed?
b. Which are the three boroughs with the highest crime indexes?
c. What has been the growth rate of Passenger Theft in the last three years?
d. Which variables are correlated?
e. Give at least two insights that catch your eye.

By using at least two regression algorithms determine:
a. What will be the crime growth in the Tlalpan borough for the next year? 
c. Do you think that crime will diminish in the next eight months?
